# Leaflet.EdgeScaleBar
Creates scale bars along top and right edge of a map in Web Mercator projection.

Change of linear scale with latitude in Web Mercator projection can affect determination of distances from the map, especially in smaller scales. This plugin gives variable scale bar along map edges (similar as on nautical chars) which can be used to detect effect of linear scale change or for determination of distances between objects.
